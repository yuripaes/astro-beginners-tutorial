### Many… legs make light work?

Did know you that…

- tandem bikes are fantastic for families; no-one has to be get left behind
- if an extra pair of legs isn't enough to get you up hills, try a tandem with electric assist
- the trident is another option for families with two full adult seats and a smaller child one at the back
